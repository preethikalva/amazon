        <hr><h1>Dolphin</h1><hr>
        <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin" target="_blank">dolphin</a> is an aquatic mammal within the infraorder Cetacea. Dolphin species belong to the families <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_dolphin" target="_blank">Delphinidae</a> (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iniidae" target="_blank" >Iniidae</a> (the New World river dolphins), Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). <br><br>There are 40 extant species named as dolphins.<br>

            Dolphins range in size from the 1.7-metre-long (5 ft 7 in) and 50-kilogram (110-pound) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft 2 in) and 10-tonne (11-short-ton) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca" target="_blank">orca</a> . Various species of dolphins exhibit sexual dimorphism where the males are larger than females.<br> They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can briefly travel at speeds of 29 kilometres (18 mi) per hour or leap about 30 feet (9.1 m).<br>Dolphins use their conical teeth to capture fast-moving prey. They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water. It is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths.<br> They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.</p><br>

            <h2>Jumping and playing</h2>

            <p>Dolphins frequently leap above the water surface, this being done for various reasons. When travelling, jumping can save the dolphin energy as there is less friction while in the air. This type of travel is known as porpoising. Other reasons include orientation, social displays, fighting, non-verbal communication, entertainment and attempting to dislodge parasites.

                Dolphins show various types of playful behavior, often including objects, self-made bubble rings, other dolphins or other animals.<br> When playing with objects or small animals, common behavior includes carrying the object or animal along using various parts of the body, passing it along to other members of the group or taking it from another member, or throwing it out of the water.<br> Dolphins have also been observed harassing animals in other ways, for example by dragging birds underwater without showing any intent to eat them.<br>Playful behaviour that involves another animal species with active participation of the other animal has also been observed. Playful dolphin interactions with humans are the most obvious examples, followed by those with humpback whales and dogs.</p>
                
        <h3>Therapy</h3>
        <p>Dolphins are an increasingly popular choice of animal-assisted therapy for psychological problems and developmental disabilities. For example, a 2005 study found dolphins an effective treatment for mild to moderate depression.<br>This study was criticized on several grounds, including a lack of knowledge on whether dolphins are more effective than common pets.<br>Reviews of this and other published dolphin-assisted therapy (DAT) studies have found important methodological flaws and have concluded that there is no compelling scientific evidence that DAT is a legitimate therapy or that it affords more than fleeting mood improvement.</p>
